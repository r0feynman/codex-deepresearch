# Plugin Scripts

`codex-deepresearch` is the plugin-local developer runner. For M1 it only validates the plugin scaffold and starts a smoke run directory; later issues add execution modes, evidence schemas, verification, and report generation.

## Smoke

From the repository root:

```bash
plugins/codex-deepresearch/scripts/codex-deepresearch smoke --install --invoke '$deep-research: Codex DeepResearch smoke test'
```

The command checks the manifest, repo-local marketplace metadata, and Codex CLI availability when `--install` is passed. It writes a timestamped directory under `research-runs/` with `status.json`.

## Install

The repo-local marketplace is `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and its marketplace name is `codex-deepresearch-local`.

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add .
codex plugin add codex-deepresearch@codex-deepresearch-local
```

Start a new Codex thread after installing so the `$deep-research` skill is loaded.

## Update

After changing plugin files, rerun validation and the smoke command:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_repo.py
python3 /home/user/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py plugins/codex-deepresearch
plugins/codex-deepresearch/scripts/codex-deepresearch smoke --install --invoke '$deep-research: Codex DeepResearch smoke test'
codex plugin add codex-deepresearch@codex-deepresearch-local
```

Start a new Codex thread after reinstalling.

## Remove

```bash
codex plugin remove codex-deepresearch@codex-deepresearch-local
```

To remove this repo marketplace from Codex as well:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace remove codex-deepresearch-local
```
